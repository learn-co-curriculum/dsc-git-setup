# Setting Up Git

## Introduction

Version control is one of the most powerful tools used by data scientists and other tech professionals. In this lesson we'll go over an overview of the steps required to set up Git.

## Objectives

You will be able to:

- Describe the steps required to set up Git

## Steps for Setting Up Git

In this lesson we'll give a high-level explanation of setting up Git that will be applicable regardless of the operating system. Then there are additional lessons with details for the different operating systems.

### 1. Git Software Installation

Git is a piece of software that must be **installed** on your computer for any of the later steps to work. By default this software only operates in the **terminal**.

Some operating systems (e.g. Mac and Linux) come with Git already installed. If you are using one of those OSs you will need to check whether Git needs to be upgraded to be compatible with the curriculum.

Once Git is installed, you will be able to **clone** (i.e. download) content stored in Git repositories. In our program, these Git repositories are stored on GitHub.

### 2. Git Configuration

Simply installing Git is enough for you to passively access content on GitHub, but you will also need to use Git to make edits and **push** (i.e. upload) your changes back to GitHub.

This means that you need to specify your **credentials** from GitHub in the local Git configuration, so that GitHub knows whether you actually have permission to push changes to a given repository.

Prior to August 2021, GitHub allowed you to use the same password used for logging in to the website. Since then the security requirements have been tightened, so you will need to set up either a personal access token or an SSH token.

## How to Use Setup Instructions

Following this lesson you will see separate lessons with instructions for each supported operating system. You only need to follow the instructions associated with your OS, and can ignore the other instructions.

## Summary

To set up Git, you need to install software and then configure it with credentials so that GitHub knows whether you should be permitted to push edits. Let's get started!
